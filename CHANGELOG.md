## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2024-06-05

### Breaking changes

- Drop support for EOL Ruby versions (older than 3.1).
- `Messenger#warn` or `Messenger#error` no longer accept literal code
  strings, and only accept various kinds of `Message` instead
  (<https://github.com/tabulard/tabulard/pull/1>).
- Prefer Hash-based `code_data` in instances of `Message`
  (<https://github.com/tabulard/tabulard/pull/3>).
- `Template` and its dependent classes are no longer systematically
  frozen, and the recommended way to instantiate them is to use
  `::build` instead of `::new`
  (<https://github.com/tabulard/tabulard/pull/7>, <https://github.com/tabulard/tabulard/pull/8>).
- Values of attributes are now required by default. To mark a value as
  optional, append a `?` to the value type name in a template. The
  previous `!` suffix is no longer supported
  (<https://github.com/tabulard/tabulard/pull/9>).

### Features

- Support the `arm64-darwin-22` platform (<https://github.com/tabulard/tabulard/pull/2>).
- The value of an attribute may be specified using a Hash of options,
  instead of a single symbol
  (<https://github.com/tabulard/tabulard/pull/8>).

### Bugfixes

- Ignore special characters in patterns derived from headers
  (<https://github.com/tabulard/tabulard/pull/5>).
